The code is a Java program for a vacation planner that helps you create an itinerary based on your budget and the number of days for your vacation.

-- selectPlaces(): This function uses dynamic programming to select a combination of places to visit within the given budget and number of days. It calculates the most optimal combination based on the places' costs and ratings. It returns a list of selected places.

-- printItinerary(): This function simply prints out the selected itinerary with details like place name, cost, and rating.

-- main(): In the main function, it takes user input for budget and number of days, creates a list of places with their costs and ratings, calls selectPlaces() to get the selected places, and then prints the itinerary using printItinerary().

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the selectPlaces function is O(N*budget) where N is the number of places and budget is the given budget. This is because there is a nested loop iterating over the number of places and the budget.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the selectPlaces function is O(N*budget) as it uses a 2D array of size N+1 and budget+1 to store the dynamic programming table.
